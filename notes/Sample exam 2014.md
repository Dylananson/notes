# Sample exam 2014
## Question 1
tautology something that is always false?

~((P^Q)^(~P^~Q))
= ~(P^Q)V~(~P^~Q)
= (~PV~Q) V (PVQ)
= ~P V ~Q V P V Q
= (~P V P) V (~Q V Q)
= True or True 
=tRue


## Question 2
### Part A
A X: algorithm(X) => TuringMachine(X)
### Part B
Church_turing thesis
### Part C
 - There are no counter examples of which an algorithm has been made that cannot be converted to a turing machine
 - 

## Question 3
(a+b+)+ | (b+a+)+

## Question 4

## Question 5
By following each transition to the furtherest point from the start state. That is if there is an empty transition from the start state then the state that if the destination of that transition would also become the start state.

## Question 9

## Question 11
### Part A
Prove by induction:

Base Case
When m+n = 0, m=0, n=0

The empty string is in the language rule (1) S->empty

Inductive Assumption
Assume every string up to m=k and n=k-1 is in the lanaguage. Where k>0

Inductive step
Prove that the string m=k+1 and n =k is in the language
From the inductive assumption we know the string m=k n=k-1 is in the language
From the CFG it can be seen that the last stage of creating this string is rule (5) T->b

Thus the option to instead add 1 to m (increase the number of a's by 1) and increase n by 1 (increase number of b's by 1) can be followed.
incstead of using T->b, use T->aTb, then use T->b, thus increasing the number of a's and b's by 1.

Therefore the string a^k+1b^k is in the string

Conclusion
By mathematical induction it has been shown that the string a^mb^n where m>=n-1 is in the language generated by the CFG

### Part B

If there is a derivation that is neither left nor right most then it is being derivered from the middle
Rule 3 generates a middle out derivations, (however also can be viewed as left and rightmost derivation).
The string abb
can be derived by following 
S->T->aTb -> abb.
Meaning that the middle thing is derived last so it is not left or rightmost derivation
## Question 11
Proof by induction
Base case n=5
F(5) - F(4) > F(4) - F(3)

f(5) = 1+1+2+3+5
f(4) = 3
f(3) = 2
5-3 > 3-2: 2>1 is True for base case

Inductive assumption

assume the statement is true when n=k and k>5 and k is an integer

Inductive Step
Prove that when n = k+1 then the statemenet is true using the inducitve assumption

By the inductive assumption 
f(k)-f(k-1)>f(k-1)-f(k-2)

Prove f(k+1)-f(k)>f(k)-f(k-1)
by the definition of the fibinacci sequence f(k+1) = f(k) + f(k-1)

Thus (f(k)+f(k-1)) - f(k) > f(k) - f(k-1)
therefore f(k-1) > f(k) - f(k-1)
f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2)
so f(k-1) > f(k-1) + f(k-2) - f(k-1)
so f(k-1) > f(k-2)
since f(k-1) = f(k-2) + f(k-3) then f(k-1)>f(k-2) must be true


### Part b
Prove not context free using the pumping lemma

using the fact that Fn - Fn-1 > Fn-1 - Fn-2
a, a, aa, aaa, aaaaa, aaaaaaaa


## Question 13
State 3 , b(a)b$
State 3, (b)bb$

State 4, ba(b)$
State 1, b(a)b$
State 3, bb(b)$
State 4, bba($)
State 2, bbab

(b) P
(c) NP
(d) NP
(e) Context Free
(f) Regular
(h) Finite
(i) P
(j) None
(k) regular
(l) r.e

## Question 16
Assume that the problem is decidable
Therefore there exists a decider R that decides whether given a string x which if given as input to M, it will eveentually erase everything on the tape after which it never writes any other symbol

Construct a decider S that solves the halting problem thereby causing a contradiction as the halting problem is proven to be undecidable

Construct S
1. given input x and a TM m, use R to check if the inputs will eventually erase everything on the tape
2. if R does erase everything on the tape then accept otherwise if it doesnt or loops for every then reject

Since R can be used to solve the halting problem then the decider R must not exist as the halting problem is proven to be undecidable.

## Question 17
If a language is recursively enumerable and not decidable then the compliment of the language must not be recursively enumerable as if both the compliment and the language is r.e then the language is decidable. Therefore a closely related langauge that is not r.e is the compliment of the r.e language that is not decidable

## Question 18
(aR V ~bR V ~cR V ~dR) ^ (aW V ~bW V ~cW V ~dW) ^ (aB V ~bB V ~cB V ~dB)

### Part B
Input: Graph
output: a CNF expression

for each edge in graph 
{
  assign a edge coloring to the edge
  create a boolean variable corresponding to True for that colour and edge pair
  

}
